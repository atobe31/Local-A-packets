# Local-A-packets
This is a SAGE code for local A-packets of classical groups.

By this code, one can compute the following: 
- Highest derivatives (in the sense of Janzten-Minguez) of irreducible representations;
- Socles of certain parabolically induced representations; 
- Aubert duals of irreducible representations; 
- Langlands data for the representations associated to extended multi-segments; 
- Local A-packets of classical groups; 
- Characters of component groups associated to extended multi-segments;
- Aubert duals of extended multi-segments; 
- The strongly equivalence class of a given extended multi-segment;
- Determination if a given irreducible representation is of Arthur type or not; 
- Decomposition of the socles of the representations parabolically induced from shifted Speh representations and representations of Arthur type; 
- Irreducibility of such parabolically induced representations; 
- First reducibility point for such parabolically induced representations.
